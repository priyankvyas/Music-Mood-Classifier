# Music-Mood-Classifier
A simple deep learning model that predicts a song's mood (happy, sad, energetic, calm) based only on audio features.

A notebook is provided that demonstrates a simple exploratory analysis of the data.

The main.py file is the entry point of the program and currently it loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame and performs some preprocessing to prepare the data for training.

## Note
Due to the large size of the dataset, it has not been included in the repository at the moment. To use the repository as is, download the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?resource=download] as a ZIP file. Extract the genres_original directory and move it to the repository root directory. Create a new directory named data and place the genres_original directory in this directory. Rename genres_original to gtzan. I will include the directory soon.
